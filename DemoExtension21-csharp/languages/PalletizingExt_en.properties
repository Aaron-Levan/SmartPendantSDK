incomplete_gripper_setup = Start Gripper Setup
incomplete_gripper_setup_desc = Your system doesn't have any grippers.  For proper operation, you need at least one gripper to pick products.<br>
incomplete_gripper_setup_desc2 = Grippers define which tools (defined in the controller) will be used and how to activate the gripper.  Later, those grippers will be associated with products to pick and release them.  You may need multiple grippers if you are hanlding a variety of products.  More grippers can always be added later on, as needed.<br>

initial_cell_setup_desc = Welcome to the guided cell setup!<br> This guide will take you through the initial steps to setup your palletizing system.
initial_cell_setup_desc1 = A robotic cell is composed of the robot and its work environment. For proper operation of PalletBuilder, you need to defined the various elements of the cell with which the robot will interact.
initial_cell_setup_desc2 = The control and flow of the cell is done using various I/O signals, variables and user frames. The first step is to defined the starting addresses for assigning the signals, variables and user frame used by PalletBuilder.

indexes_setup = Indexes Setup
indexes_setup_desc = Please enter the starting index for each type of values.
start_index = Start Index
index_io = Input/Output Signals
index_io_desc = I/O signals are used by stations to indicate the status and receive signals from sensors and buttons.
index_var = Variables
index_var_desc = Variables range is from 0 to 127 (some system may have a higher range).  PalletBuilder uses mainly Integers for counters, Double for dimensions or shift amounts and String for station assignments.
index_uf = User Frames
index_uf_desc = User frames are used to defined the origin and orientation of each stations.  Their range is between 1 and 64.
index_note = <b>Note:</b> The I/O signals, variables and user frames will be assigned sequencially from the starting index as they are assigned to stations but you will have the opportunaty to manually assign to different location if desired.  Depending on the station type, stations generally uses 1 or 2 addresses of each type.

station_selection = Cell Station Selection
station_selection_desc = Select the number of stations for each type of station in the cell.
station_count = Station Count

master_job = Supervisor Job Generation
master_job_desc = The job 'PALLETBUILDER_SUPEVISOR' is a specific job that is generated by PalletBuilder to control the flow between the stations in the cell. It is automatically called when starting operations from the 'Cell Operation' screen.
master_job_flow = The 'Supervisor Job Flow' integer variable (I-var) controls if the palletizing should continue or stop after the current cycle.
master_tracking = The 'Build Station Tracking' integer variable (I-var) is used when multiple build stations are available to keep track of which station is currently active.
master_sequence = Two sequencing modes are available: alternate between stations after each cycle or change station once the current station is completed. 

setup_complete = Congratulations! Your cell setup is complete. 
setup_complete_desc = If modifications are required later on, the existing setup can be modified but going to the 'CELL SETUP' tab.
continue_build_pattern = The next step should be to add some products and create new build patterns. You can make new build pattern by using the "Guided Build Pattern Creation" button below or later by going to the 'Home' screen and pressing the button there.
