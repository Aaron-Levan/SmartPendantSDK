    <h2><strong><b>Grippers</b></strong></h2>
    <p>
        This page can be used to define the grippers that are used in the palletization cell.&nbsp; Each gripper will require an empty tool and loaded tool which define gripper parameters when holding a product or not.&nbsp;
    </p>   

<p>Tools define the location of the control point (TCP) and its properties (weight, center of gravity...).&nbsp; It is important that the empty tool and the loaded tool have the same TCP definition, only the weight, center of gravity and inertia should be different.&nbsp; It is possible to reference the same tool number for empty and loaded tools when the weight of the part is relatively small in regard to the tool itself and the robot payload.&nbsp; Note that collaborative robots (HC-robot) are more sensible to weight variations and normally require use of different tools.&nbsp;
</p> 

<p>
Tools are taught using the Smart Pendant tools menu which is accessible by pressing the gear icon next to the 'Empty Tool' or ‘Loaded Tool’ selection box.&nbsp; Tool should be defined so that the TCP is in the center of the top surface of a product being picked.&nbsp; The Z-axis of the tool should be pointing down toward the product.&nbsp;
</p> 

<p>
Two options are available to define how a gripper operates: Simple and Complex.&nbsp; Simple grippers require an Output# that activates the gripper and timers to allow a gripper to take or release a product.&nbsp; If you are using a gripper with reverse output logic, the invert option can be checked.&nbsp; Complex control allows one to operate grippers using external jobs for more complex grippers that would require multiple signals or to wait for an activation confirmation signal.&nbsp;
