    <h2><strong><b>Build Editor</b></strong></h2>
    <p>
      Once your pick operation and place layer jobs have been created, you can define how the jobs are assembled together to form a stack of layers on a pallet at your build stations.&nbsp; 
    </p>
        First, select a build station, the box product being placed on the pallet and the pallet being used.&nbsp;
        Once selected, a list of layer jobs will appear.&nbsp; Select the layer to be added from the list.  If the product of that layer has multiple pick operations defined for it, a list of the possible pick operations will appear too.&nbsp;
        The selected layer job can be added to the stack
        by pressing the <b>Add Layer on Top</b> button.&nbsp; The layer appears in the table below representing the stack of layers.&nbsp; Layers from stack can be removed using the <b>Delete Selected Layer</b> button.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	Once a build pattern is complete, press the <b>Save & Generate Job</b> button.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	<b>Note</b>: Pallets handled by your robot can only be placed as the first layer of the stack.
