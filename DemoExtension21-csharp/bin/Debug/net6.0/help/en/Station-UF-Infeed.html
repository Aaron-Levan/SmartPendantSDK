    <h2><strong><b>Infeed Station User Frame</b></strong></h2>    
    <p>
      Every station has a user frame associated with it and the taught path are relative to that user frame.&nbsp;
      User frames are taught using the Smart Pendant normal interface which is accessible by pressing the 'Gear' icon next to the 'User Frame' selection box.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      For proper operation, the infeed user frame should be taught at the end of the conveyor on the right side, on the surface where the boxes rest (on top of the rolls).&nbsp; 
      The X-axis should be along the conveyor side pointing against the flow of incoming product and the Y-axis along the front of the conveyor.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p> 
      For teaching, make sure that you have the correct tool # selected to represent the location on the tool used to teach.&nbsp;
      If it is difficult to reach the proper location, you can put a box in user frame location and teach on top of the box.&nbsp;
      Then after completing teaching, substract the height of the box from the user frame Z value.&nbsp;
