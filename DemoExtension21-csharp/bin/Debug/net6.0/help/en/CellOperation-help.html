    <h2><strong><b>Cell Operation</b></strong></h2>
   <p>Once all of your stations, products and jobs have been defined, the cell operation screen can be used to control and monitor your palletization cell.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Before running your cell, PalletBuilder needs to know what stations will be active and what they will be working with.&nbsp;</p>
   	<ul>
   		<li><b>Build</b>: Assign the build pattern job</li>
   		<li><b>Infeed</b>: Assign the box to be picked up from the station</li>
      <li><b>Dispenser Fixed/Search</b>: Assign the separators or pallets that the dispenser stations will provide.</li>
   	</ul>
   <p>When you assign a build station, you will be prompted for automatic assignments of other stations with products used in the assigned build pattern.  Alternatively, you may assign those stations manually.  However, if you are using a pick job that can be shared by stations of the same type, you will be instructed to assign a station manually.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>While in TEACH mode, the <b>Test Supervisor Job</b> can be pressed to open the supervisor job on the pendant and the Test/Run Job Panel.&nbsp; This can be used to check if the palletization pattern will operate as desired prior to running.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>When in PLAY mode, the cell has two start modes <b>Start Top of Supervisor</b> and <b>Resume</b>.&nbsp; The <b>Start Top of Supervisor</b> button will start the palletization supervisor job, PALLETBUILDER_SUPERVISOR, from the beginning.&nbsp; The <b>Resume</b> will initiate the palletization supervisor job from its current line.&nbsp; To start the cell, complete all station assignments then press and hold one of the start buttons.</p>
    <p>While a cell is running, depending on whether I/O are used or not, circular indicators will appear on the station details screen displaying the status of the used I/O signals.&nbsp; For build stations, the bottom screen will display the values of the current layer and cycle.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A cell can be stopped in two ways. The <b>Stop on Cycle Complete</b> button lets the palletization job complete its current cycle before stopping.&nbsp; Whereas the <b>Stop</b> button pauses the palletization job at its current line.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: For proper operation, the Playback Mode on the TEST/RUN JOB panel must be set to "One Cycle".</p>
