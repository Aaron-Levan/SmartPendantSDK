    <h2><strong><b>Dispenser Station User Frame</b></strong></h2>    
    <p>
      Every station has a user frame associated with it and the taught path are relative to that user frame.&nbsp;
      User frames are taught using the Smart Pendant normal interface which is accessible by pressing the 'Gear' icon next to the 'User Frame' selection box.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      For proper operation, the search stack dispenser station user frame should be taught on the surface where the separator will be (bottom plate), in one of its corner (preferably a corner that doesn't move if the separator size changes).&nbsp; 
      The X-axis and Y-axis should be taught along the two separator sides so that the Z-axis is point upward according to the right-hand rule.&nbsp; 
    </p>

    <p> 
      For teaching, make sure that you have the correct tool # selected to represent the location on the tool used to teach.&nbsp;
      If it is difficult to reach the proper location, you can teach on top of the dispenser (top of corner posts).&nbsp;
      Then after completing teaching, substract the height of the posts from the user frame Z value.&nbsp;
