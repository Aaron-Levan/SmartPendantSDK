    <h2><strong><b>Manage Jobs</b></strong></h2>
   <p>View a list of pick or place layer jobs.&nbsp; Select a job from the list and press the <b>Edit</b> button to modify job or create a new job using
      the <b>New</b> button.&nbsp; Once a job is created, it will appear in the list.&nbsp; The status of a job
      is reflected in the <i>Job Status</i> column.&nbsp; If a job's station has been deleted, the station will appear as "(Undefined)"</p>
      
    <p><b>Job Statuses</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>OK</i>: The job is acceptable and ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Missing</i>: The job is no longer on the controller.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Unrelated</i>: The job exists on the controller but it was not generated by PalletBuilder or the job tag differs from "PALLETBUILDER".&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Modified</i>: The job was modified outside of PalletBuilder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Old</i>: The job on the controller is older than the one noted in the database.&nbsp; An older version might have been loaded into the controller.&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <p>Generally, you may want to generate jobs that do not have an <i>OK</i> status.&nbsp; This can be done using the <b>Generate Job</b> button.&nbsp;
         Jobs can be deleted or copied using the <b>Delete</b> button or <b>Duplicate</b> buttons respectively.
